# Home Assistant

This home automation setup is based on [Home Assistant](https://www.home-assistant.io), with almost all logic implemented in Python through the [AppDaemon add-on](https://github.com/hassio-addons/addon-appdaemon).

The goal of this setup is to require as little input from users as possible - instead reacting to presence, time, climate and more.

## Usage Instructions & User Interface

Usage instructions are provided in a dedicated dashboard, as shown below:

![Guide](ui-screenshots/guide.png "Guide")

The main dashboard shows an overview of the entire system with integrated controls and conditional warnings (e.g. dog water bowl empty or plants need watering). This is done succinctly so as to fit on a single phone screen view without scrolling.

The remaining dashboards include detailed settings, controls, and sensors for lighting, climate control, presence monitoring, electicity usage, and plant watering.
