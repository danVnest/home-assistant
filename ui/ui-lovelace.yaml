          **Lighting** and **climate settings** (if enabled) are automatically
          adjusted between different scenes. You can also manually select a
          preferred scene here, or tell Siri/Google:

          - **"lights on"** or **"lights off"** for the *Night* and *Day* scenes

          - **"lights on bright"** for the *Bright* scene

          - **"sleep time"** for the *Sleep* scene


          **Automatic climate control** will control all aircon units based on
          the current scene and the temperature throughout the house as well as
          outside. **Aircon** can also be manually turned on and off. These
          settings can be controlled by telling Siri/Google:

          - **"climate control on"** or **"climate control off"**

          - **"aircon on"** or **"aircon off"**


          Each **scene** has a particular purpose:

          - ***Morning*** is designed to trigger before anyone wakes up (at the
          time specified in the settings here), providing dim kitchen lighting
          plus climate control to the whole house (rather than just the
          bedroom). Thus when anyone does get up it is to a comfortable
          temperature and sufficient lighting.

          - ***Day*** is triggered when ambient lighting in the house is
          sufficient, and thus turns off all lighting.

          - ***Night*** is triggered when there is insufficent lighting, turning
          on the main lights in the house. The brightness and colour temperature
          of all lighting adjusts as the night goes on, getting dimmer and
          warmer so as to reduce the impact to your circadian rhythm.

          - ***Sleep*** turns off all lighting in the house. If climate control
          is enabled, only the bedroom is monitored and controlled. This scene
          has to be manually triggered.

          - ***TV*** dims the lights for a nice viewing experience,
          automatically triggered when the TV is playing at Night.

          - ***Bright*** turns all lights on at full brightness and has to be
          manually triggered.

          - ***Away (Night/Day)*** turns off all lights (except one obvious one
          at night for security purposes) and disables climate control.
          Automatically triggered when both of us have left the house.


          The **buttons** in the kitchen and bedroom will essentially toggle
          lighting when clicked, intelligently changing the scene based on the
          current conditions. The bedroom button also allows you to first switch
          from ***Night*** to ***Sleep*** while keeping the bedroom light on,
          then when clicked again it will turn the bedroom light off (properly
          entering ***Sleep***). Holding either button for a few seconds will
          toggle the aircon.


          Lighting in the entryway, kitchen, office and bedroom will
          automatically brighten when someone enters, and dim shortly after they
          leave (depending on scene settings). Automatic bedroom lighting is
          disabled as soon as the ***Sleep*** scene starts, only enabling again
          when the bedroom **button** is clicked or after luminance levels peak
          (i.e. after blinds are first opened in the morning).


          Only the bedroom aircon will be controlled after the specified bed
          time, regardless of the scene.

              Lighting at night will gradually transition between the intial and
              final brightness and colour values specified here.


              Initial circadian settings occur after sunset (specified in hours
              by *initial sunset offset*) and reaches the final values at *end
              time*.

              Values here specify the *brightness* and colour temperature of
              lighting in different scenes. Colour temperature ranges from warm
              white (2000 *kelvin*) to cold white (4500 *kelvin*).


              *Motion* indicates the value is specific to when the room is
              occupied (otherwise defaulting to the normal values specified, the
              current circadian value, off, or maximum - depending on the
              scene).


              *Vacating delay* specifies how long the light will wait after
              someone leaves the room before reverting to its previous state.


              If a *transition period* is available the light will smoothly
              change over that period to or from the motion brightness and
              kelvin specified or implied.
