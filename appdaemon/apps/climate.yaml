Climate:
  module: climate
  class: Climate
  inside_outside_trigger: 2 # difference between outside and inside temperatures which triggers suggestion
  target_buffer:
    temperature: 1 # difference between actual device target temperature and the temperature which triggers device off
    humidity: 10 # difference between actual device target humidity and the humidity which triggers device off
  fan:
    cooling_per_speed: 0.1 # degrees reduction in apparent temperature for each percent of fan speed (max fan_airspeed = 0.1*100/0.7)
    cooling_reduction_factor_when_reverse: 3.5 # the factor of which cooling is reduced when a fan is in reverse (also see fan_airspeed macro)
    reversing_delay: 5 # number of seconds to allow between fan reversal steps
  aircon_reduce_fan:
    delay: 15 # number of seconds before the aircon fan reduces after its closest door opens
    temperature_threshold: 2 # minimum temperature off target before fan reduces (when door open)
  adjustment_delay: 300 # minimum number of seconds delay between seqential device adjustments (per device)
